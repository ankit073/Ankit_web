                <h4 style="padding: 10px;" style="display: inline-block;"><br>&emsp; &emsp; Hi, I am Ankit Anand, a BS-MS student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal. I have much interest in Mathematics and aim to major in Maths. I am also the Department Representative of Mathematics for the session 2025-26. Being DR, I work as a bridge between students and faculty, ensuring smooth communication, academic support, and growth within the department.<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; Passionate about sports—especially athletics and long-distance running—I have proudly represented IISER Bhopal in IISM 2024 and have participated in multiple marathons. I am a Core Committee Member of the Sports Council enjoy working in roles that involve event management, logistics, and coordination. I am also a cadet of the 1 MP Naval Unit, NCC, which has strengthened my discipline, leadership, and teamwork. <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; I strive to contribute actively to both the academic and sports communities at IISERB, fostering participation, teamwork, and an energetic campus environment.</h4>
