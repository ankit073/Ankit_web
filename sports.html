        <h1>Athletics</h1>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alongside academics, I have actively participated in various sports and fitness activities. At school, I proudly represented Sainik School Goalpara in CBSE Far East zone chess championship twice, which helped me sharpen my focus and strategic thinking. At Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, I represented the institute in the Inter IISER Sports Meet (IISM 2024), gaining valuable experience in competitive sports. I also tested my endurance by participating in the Army Marathon, Bhopal (5 km) and the Bansal Pankh Marathon, Bhopal (10 km). Beyond these, I continue to engage in diverse sports activities at IISER Bhopal, which help me stay energetic, disciplined, and motivated. <br><br>

        <hr><h1>National Cadet Corps (NCC)</h1>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My association with the National Cadet Corps (NCC) has been an enriching part of my journey. During my school years at Sainik School Goalpara, I was an active cadet in the Army Wing, where I successfully earned both the ‘A’ and ‘B’ Certificates. The training, drills, and camps during this period instilled in me values of discipline, leadership, and resilience. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, at IISER Bhopal, I have joined the Naval NCC, further broadening my experience and exposure. This opportunity allows me to continue learning, exploring maritime skills, and carrying forward the spirit of service, teamwork, and responsibility.</p>
